# Traveling-Salesman-Problem


**Objective of the Mini-Project:**

From a given set of N cities and distance between each pair of the cities, find the minimum path length in such a way that it covers each and every city exactly once (without repetition of any path) and terminate the traversal at the starting point or the starting city from where the traversal of the TSP Algorithm was initiated.


**Theoretical Background:**

An array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. Array can be classified into different types, namely one dimensional (1D) array, two dimensional (2D) array and multidimensional array. Here we have used 2D array.
Implementing a database of information as a collection of arrays can be inconvenient when we have to pass many arrays to utility functions to process the database. It would be nice to have a single data structure which can hold all the information, and pass it all at once. 2-dimensional arrays provide most of this capability. Like a 1D array, a 2D array is a collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name. However, a 2D array is organized as a matrix with a number of rows and columns.


**Algorithm:**

**Step 1:** Start

**Step 2:** Initializing number of cities and distances between each cities.

**Step 3:** Finding the minimum path to be taken by the salesman (using if statement)

**Step 4:** Finding minimum distance to be covered by the salesman (using for loop and if statement)

**Step 5:** Displaying the minimum path and distance

**Step 6:** Stop

**Conclusion:**

Here, we focused on a special type of travelling problem where the objective was to deliver n different objects to n different cities. This problem was solved by a special method known as Hungarian method. By this method we found minimum distance and shortest path. Further, this method can also be used to solve problems like transportation problem and crew assignment problem.
